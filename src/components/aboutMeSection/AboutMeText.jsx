      <p>
        Iâ€™m a detail-oriented full-stack web developer skilled in both frontend and backend development.
         My core tech stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScri pt, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase.
          I also have hands-on experience with authentication systems, API development, RESTful services, and deploying production-ready applications.
          I thrive in building scalable, maintainable applications with a focus on clean code, performance, and responsive design.
          I value collaboration, version control (Git), and agile development practices.
          I'm committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with evolving web technologies.
          I'm currently open to remote developer roles, freelance gigs, and team collaborations.
